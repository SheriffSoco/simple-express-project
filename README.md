# MERN Demo Project
This is a educational project, following the steps from [The MERN Fullstack Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-nodejs-express-mongodb-the-mern-fullstack-guide/) by Academind.

This repository holds the Express code that maintains the REST API. The React code can be found [here](https://github.com/SheriffSoco/mern-demo). This project creates a list of places. Each place contains a title, description, address, and photo. Places can be viewed from Google Maps. Places can be created, updated, and deleted by registered users. Additional querying allows places to be searched by ID or by user ID.
